# General instructions for Copilot  

- Always respond in Japanese
- But generate code in English by default. but if you are editing existing code, use the same language as the original code.

# Python style

- Use pathlib over os.path
- Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) over pip if you can. but use repository's package manager if it is not uv.
