<h2>Code Quality</h2>

They argue that developers are now too reliant on Stack Overflow and are not taking the time to understand the underlying concepts. Others argue that Stack Overflow is a valuable learning resource, as it allows developers to see how other people have solved problems and to learn from their mistakes.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Some users suggest that Stack Overflow has created a more toxic community around the C language. They argue that people are quick to downvote questions and answers, and that it is difficult to get help if you are a beginner. Others argue that Stack Overflow has made the C language community more accessible, as it allows people from all over the world to connect and share their knowledge.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
